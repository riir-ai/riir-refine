# AGENTS.md — riir-clippy

The global `~/.agents/` rules apply; this file documents repo-local context.

## Role

**Multi-domain modelless code healer** — a pluggable framework behind the
`HealDomain` trait (Plan 001) that heals code across multiple domains using a
drafter+pruner+corpus pattern. This is a **developer tooling repo**, NOT a
game concern, NOT a training repo, NOT a chain repo.

Three domains ship (Plan 001):
1. **`clippy_lints`** (default-on) — heals `cargo clippy` warnings. The
   original domain; 10 common lints across style/complexity/perf/nursery.
2. **`rust_perf`** (default-on since 2026-08-13, Phase 2) — heals rust perf
   issues. 46 rules distilled from the `rust-optimize` skill checklist +
   nnethercote/perf-book + rustc-hash/bevy real-world patterns (complexity,
   allocation, layout, concurrency, simd, arithmetic, iterators, dispatch,
   caching, io, bevy, wasm). The **perf-bench
   Pareto validator** (Bench 013 promotion gate + Bench 015 Phase 4
   finalization + Bench 016 Issue 012 expansion + Bench 017 Issue 013 data-structure-choice
   expansion, `rust_perf_bench` feature) is the promotion gate — GOAT G1+G5 PASS.
   6 of 38 benchable rules (`precompute-table`, `papaya-lockfree`,
   `dedupe-hashset-vs-vec`, `reuse-allocation-clear`, `sort-by-key`,
   `copy-from-slice`) carry `context_notes` annotations recording the
   bench finding (Bench 015 + Bench 016: 2 ParetoDominated + 4 regime-fragile/Mixed in the
   default config — consumers should treat annotated rules as
   context-dependent).
3. **`kernel_opt`** (opt-in, Phase 3) — heals GPU kernel optimization. 203 rules
   (Batch 1-6: 50 popcorn-distilled from Research 002-007; Batch 7: 9 burn-cubecl
   Rust-native autotune dispatch + conv-as-GEMM + layout rules from Research 008;

   Batch 14: 4 riir-gpu production-kernel rules (norm-fold into matmul, reduction-split pre-pass, single-plane reduction, CPU-bottleneck offload) from Research 015 — the first batch mining the stack's own kernels, not external libraries);
   Batch 15: 4 riir-gpu production-kernel rules (block-contiguous weight layout, fused dual GEMV + GeGLU, orthogonal pre-rotation, water-fill tail-dim shared codebook) from Research 016 — the second batch mining the stack's own kernels (ternary GEMM + fused GeGLU GEMV + SpectralQuant);
   Batch 16: 4 riir-gpu production-kernel rules (cmma hardware unit, dequant-once-per-k-tile, dispatch axis swap, norm-decoupled low-bit scoring) from Research 017 — the third batch mining the stack's own kernels (gemm_ternary_simdgroup + forward_turboquant).
   Batch 17: 4 riir-gpu production-kernel rules (skip-all-zero-packed-words-via-or-reduce, hoist-group-invariant-scale-out-of-word-loop, split-sign-accumulators-defer-subtraction, clamp-tile-indices-to-sentinel-discard-at-write) from Research 018 — the fourth batch mining the stack's own kernels (gemm_ternary_batched + gemv_ternary_block_contiguous — the ternary scalar-ALU hot loop). Absorbs Proposal 012's design
   (thermal-tier + latent-MoE + numeric validator); 4090 LoRA deferred.

   (thermal-tier + latent-MoE + numeric validator); 4090 LoRA deferred.
   Batch 19: 2 riir-gpu production-kernel rules (chain-dispatches-single-sync-point, fuse-residual-via-in-place-output-array) from Research 020 — the sixth batch mining the stack's own kernels (ternary_ffn_fused + gemv_ternary_residual_cubecl — command-buffer-level dispatch fusion + in-place output-array parameter-count bypass).

   (thermal-tier + latent-MoE + numeric validator); 4090 LoRA deferred.
   Batch 20: 5 riir-gpu production-kernel rules (cooperative-block-wide-quantize-staging, byte-perm-lut-via-permutation-immediate, dp4a-int8-hardware-dot-product, threadgroup-subset-sum-lut-keyed-by-activation, base-3-trit-packing-5-per-byte) from Research 021 — the seventh batch mining the stack's own kernels (gemv_ternary_cuda_raw + gemv_ternary_cubecl LUT/trit paths — first CUDA-specific hardware-instruction cluster: __byte_perm permutation LUT + __dp4a int8 dot product + cooperative block-wide quantize staging; plus CubeCL threadgroup subset-sum LUT keyed by activation + base-3 trit packing). Absorbs Proposal 012's design

   Batch 21: 5 riir-gpu production-kernel rules (cross-runtime-raw-handle-extraction, pool-buffer-aliasing-dedicated-output, same-queue-implicit-ordering-no-sync, per-dispatch-pointer-re-extraction, no-blocking-sync-in-async-pipeline) from Research 022 — the eighth batch mining the stack's own kernels (gemm_ternary_metal_zero_copy — the Metal cross-runtime zero-copy integration cluster: raw `id<MTLBuffer>` extraction from CubeCL/wgpu handles + pool-buffer aliasing hazard workaround + same-queue implicit ordering + per-dispatch pointer re-extraction + no-blocking-sync in async pipeline; patterns are generic for any wrapper-runtime→raw-native-dispatch integration). Absorbs Proposal 012's design
   (thermal-tier + latent-MoE + numeric validator); 4090 LoRA deferred.
   Batch 22: 5 riir-gpu production-kernel rules (dynamic-shared-memory-runtime-sized, ternary-bit-plane-u64-as-2x-u32, warp-shuffle-intrinsics-for-sub-warp-reduction, fused-activation-quantize-for-gemv-consumer, cuda-graph-scalar-via-device-pointer) from Research 023 — the ninth batch mining the stack's own kernels (cudarc_kernels/ — the full raw-CUDA forward port for Issue 615: embedding + attention + elementwise + deltanet; patterns include `extern __shared__` runtime-sized smem, bit-plane ternary dequant, `__shfl_down_sync` warp reduction for ≤32-thread blocks, activation+quantize fusion for GEMV consumers, and `_devpos` variants for CUDA Graph capture). Absorbs Proposal 012's design
   (thermal-tier + latent-MoE + numeric validator); 4090 LoRA deferred.
   Batch 23: 5 riir-gpu production-kernel rules (combined-kv-buffer-keys-then-values, gqa-kv-head-sharing-bandwidth-reduction, softcap-tanh-attention-score, fold-query-tokens-for-occupancy, hardcoded-fast-path-jit-specialization) from Research 024 — the tenth batch mining the stack's own kernels (attention_cubecl/ — the `CubeCL` flash-attention decode cluster: combined KV buffer `[keys | values]`, GQA KV-head sharing via `kv_group = head_idx * n_kv_head / n_head`, Gemma's `softcap * tanh(score/softcap)` bounded logits, fold-factor query-token coalescing for speculative-decode occupancy, and hardcoded fast-path vs parametric JIT specialization; ~24% decode throughput gain on M3 Max). Absorbs Proposal 012's design
   (thermal-tier + latent-MoE + numeric validator); 4090 LoRA deferred.
   Batch 24: 4 riir-gpu production-kernel rules (widen-index-multiply-to-64bit, dual-accumulator-single-reduction-sweep, dual-grad-same-pass, broadcast-uniform-skip-reduce) from Research 025 — the eleventh batch mining the stack's own kernels (cudarc_kernels/backward.rs — the Issue 641 per-layer backward cluster; closes `cudarc_kernels/` 6/6: 64-bit index widening for address math on large buffers, two block reductions fused into one sweep sharing loads + barrier tree, both partials of a product-rule activation in one kernel sharing one sigmoid eval, and thread-uniform values broadcast-not-reduced — the T7.2 validation catch where z came out blockDim.x× too large). Absorbs Proposal 012's design
   (thermal-tier + latent-MoE + numeric validator); 4090 LoRA deferred.
   Batch 25: 5 riir-gpu production-kernel rules (device-side-argmax-minimal-download, monotone-transform-elision-under-argmax, fan-out-shared-input-single-sync, hot-swap-weights-preserve-autotune-caches, tree-reduction-depth-over-sequential-accumulate) from Research 026 — the twelfth batch mining the stack's own kernels (the Gemma cluster: gemma2_cubecl/ + gemma4_cubecl/ — GPU argmax downloads 4 B instead of ~1 MB logits/token, strictly monotone softcap skipped under argmax-only consumers, N sibling QKV dispatches sharing one uploaded input + one batched sync, `replace_weights` hot-swap keeping autotune + JIT caches alive across LoRA steps, and plane tree-reduction depth ≈77 vs sequential 2304 for ~30× backward accuracy — the Issue 424 gradient-divergence fix). Absorbs Proposal 012's design
   (thermal-tier + latent-MoE + numeric validator); 4090 LoRA deferred.
   Batch 26: 8 riir-gpu production-kernel rules (per-slot-uniform-buffer-write-ordering, derive-params-from-global-invocation-id, merge-dispatches-into-single-compute-pass, batched-downloads-single-sync-cycle, chunk-encoder-submits-below-driver-limit, prebuilt-bind-groups-fixed-buffer-combos, host-cache-immutable-device-weights, defer-readback-until-after-submit) from Research 027 — the thirteenth batch mining the stack's own kernels (forward/ + buffer.rs — the wgpu forward-orchestration cluster, the first HOST-SIDE batch: wgpu flushes all `queue.write_buffer` calls before the encoder executes so shared uniforms corrupt (per-slot fix), per-item params encoded in the dispatch grid + decoded in-kernel (n_head × seq_len workgroups, one dispatch), dependent dispatches merged into one compute pass with in-order semantics + copies on the copy channel, N readbacks sharing one encoder/submit/map/poll (~1.28 ms per measured sync), Metal compute-pass-per-encoder DEADLOCK avoided by chunked immediate submits (~48 passes/chunk, env-tunable), fixed-combo bind groups pre-built at init (~768 `create_bind_group` calls per forward → 0), immutable weights host-cached at init (per-call download was the #1 forward bottleneck at 2 sync stalls), and readback deferred until after submit (mid-encoder downloads read stale pre-submission state). Absorbs Proposal 012's design
   (thermal-tier + latent-MoE + numeric validator); 4090 LoRA deferred.
   Batch 27: 6 riir-gpu production-kernel rules (staging-packed-uniforms-encoder-ordered-copies, identical-uniforms-share-single-slot, persistent-zeros-source-encoder-copy-clear, fuse-sibling-target-grads-single-kernel, per-layer-strided-grad-destination, snapshot-transient-grad-for-deferred-download) from Research 028 — the fourteenth batch mining the stack's own kernels (backward/ + backward_dflash/ — the backward-pass orchestration clusters, completing the host-orchestration trilogy: all uniform params packed into ONE 16-byte-aligned staging vec + ONE upload + encoder-ordered per-dispatch copies (the 1-buffer complement to per-slot's N buffers), the idempotent-write exemption (sharing is safe IFF every write is byte-identical — N uniforms + N bind groups → 1), persistent device zeros + encoder-timeline copy clears (queue writes flush before the whole encoder so layer 1 would accumulate on layer 0's values; three-way independent mining convergence), sibling-target backward fusion per KERNEL KIND (one summed d_input + one grid-sized param-grad dispatch; 6 → 2), consumer-selected layer-major strided grad destinations (the per-layer split falls out of the existing pass — no de-interleave), and transient-grad snapshots into persistent buffers for deferred download (the LIFETIME complement to defer-readback's TIMING rule). Mining also surfaced a suspected live bug in backward_dflash (uniforms written via queue.write_buffer DURING encoder build → wrong query_pos for all but the last position per chunk with chunk_size=2) — filed as a riir-ai issue. Absorbs Proposal 012's design
   (thermal-tier + latent-MoE + numeric validator); 4090 LoRA deferred.
   Batch 28: 10 riir-gpu production-kernel rules (row-owned-register-blocked-recurrence, workgroup-equals-plane-native-reduction, smem-broadcast-scalar-then-parallel-scatter, token-flattened-elementwise-modulo-shared-weights, fused-conv-state-shift-dot-silu, softplus-piecewise-saturation-clamp, reverse-running-decay-weight, split-decay-outputs-eliminate-readback, carry-dual-layout-dead-slot, nonlinearity-forces-raw-input-buffers) from Research 029 — the fifteenth batch mining the stack's own kernels (deltanet_cubecl.rs + deltanet_chunked_cubecl.rs — the deltanet CubeCL cluster, the two largest single files in the crate: decode-time recurrence + chunkwise-parallel prefill): state-matrix row ownership with register blocking (rows independent within one decode step → one workgroup per (head,row), 4R+2W → 1R+1W global passes, ~3× memory-bound cut, 32× occupancy headroom; Issue 619), plane-sized workgroup geometry (size to EXACTLY one hardware plane + register-block width — native shuffle covers the full reduction, broadcasts free, zero barriers; the Issue 610 plane_sum-caught-1/4 hazard is the inverse), post-reduction broadcast scatter (leader publishes the scalar through the already-reduced slot, ALL threads scatter — 1 write/thread vs head_dim serial leader writes; Issue 616), mixed-arity launch flattening ([p, n_head] → one 1-D index space with per-head weights via i % n_head; 6144 → 48 dispatches), fused in-place conv shift+dot+SiLU decode kernel, far-tail softplus saturation clamp (±20, pinned to the CPU reference), dematerialized decay matrix (one running scalar, j downward, empty-product anchor — the inverse of cumsum-gate-to-decay-matrix), consumer-shaped output split (packing that breaks consumer layouts forces readback-unpack-reupload; write [H,C] + [H] directly), parameterized dual-layout carry with a provably-dead slot (prefill writes decode's conv_state natively; slot 0 stale — the decode shift overwrites before read), and the nonlinearity buffer contract (sequential in-place tricks are incompatible with batching when a nonlinearity intervenes — raw RO inputs + WO outputs; the negative space of inplace-output-alias). Corpus 183 → 193 (B 33, C 19, D 26, E 11, G 19, L 6). Mining CONFIRMED a production bug (deltanet_cross_chunk_f32 plane_sum mixes partials of different columns → block-constant output, masked by test tolerance, production-wired via prefill_deltanet_recurrence_chunked) + 3 latent/edge bugs (legacy recurrence broken for head_dim≠128 while being the documented fallback; partial-chunk carry GPU-vs-CPU divergence; GPU L2-normalize missing the CPU zero-norm guard) — filed as a riir-ai issue.
   Batch 29: 10 riir-gpu production-kernel rules (defer-readback-gated-by-live-output-size, weight-handle-cache-keyed-by-allocation-identity, first-readback-pays-queue-drain, epilogue-at-register-write-phase, delay-rms-scale-past-gemv-epilogue, pack-scalar-params-into-combined-buffer, enum-dispatch-separate-kernel-per-variant, epilogue-must-be-workgroup-local, launch-unchecked-caller-owned-size-contract, fast-math-contraction-behind-feature-flag) from Research 030 — the sixteenth batch mining the stack's own kernels (deltanet_input_proj_fused.rs + epilogue/ — the decode-path fusion cluster: Issue 602 sibling-GEMV fan-out + Plan 106 Track 3 CODA epilogue fusion; ternary_deltanet_gpu_forward.rs deliberately skipped — sibling actively working there): the readback-deferral footprint gate (Bench 437's 5 concurrent ~70 KB FFN buffers measured 16% SLOWER vs ~8 KB input-proj outputs chaining freely — deferral is NOT unconditional), pointer-identity device-handle caching (CPU weight refs → lock-free cache keyed by the allocation's (pos, neg) pointer pair, on-the-fly miss path), the queue-drain readback cost model (first read drains the burst's queue, later reads free — syncs are a function of BURSTS, not read calls), the CODA register-phase epilogue (memory-bound elementwise ops execute while the GEMV output is still in registers, riding lane 0's single store; 2→1 dispatches, 52/26 layers), the delayed-RMS commutation (RMSNorm(x)@W = r·(x·γ)@W with the honest 3→3 accounting — the win is dispatch overhead, not bandwidth), packed scalar params for the ~4-5 Array budget (u32s bitcast through the f32 pack), enum + one-kernel-per-variant under the no-generics DSL constraint, workgroup-local fusion legality (ownership scope, not just dependency), launch_unchecked + # Safety size contracts, and fast-math contraction behind a cfg_attr feature pair (strict-FP default byte-identical). Corpus 193 → 203 (A 29, B 34, C 21, D 29, E 12, M 6). First standing syn-parse gate (batch29_pseudocode_parses). Mining surfaced 2 latent cache hazards + a stale-doc-numbers bug — filed as riir-ai Issue 674.

The pipeline (shared across all domains):
1. **L0 — Rule distillation**: each rule → named entry + bounded fix-space
2. **L1 — Plasma/hot path drafter**: modelless ternary SIMD matvec, zero-alloc (Issue 001, DONE)
3. **L2 — Validator**: `syn`-based syntax parse check (always-on, modelless — Issue 002, DONE).
   Domain-specific verification is opt-in:
   - clippy: `cargo clippy` re-run (`clippy_verify`, Issue 003, DONE)
   - rust_perf: `cargo test` re-run (`rust_perf_verify`, Plan 001 Phase 2, DONE)
   - kernel_opt: CubeCL compile (`kernel_verify`, Plan 001 Phase 3, STUB —
     full numeric compare deferred per Proposal 012 §Phase 0)
4. **L3 — Ruliology candidate search** (opt-in): Pareto-front enumeration
5. **L4 — LoRA fallback** (deferred): adaptive learning, last resort

**Plan 005 (2026-08-14) — latent retrieval + `cargo heal --suggest` CLI
(Phases 1–4 DONE).** `src/draft/` ships the span-level retrieval layer:
real `.rs` files → `AstChunker` spans → 8-D modelless embedding →
domain-centroid routing (annotation only) → fan-out retrieval against
per-domain latent indexes of the corpus → ranked rules + pattern
snippets. ZERO retrieval code reimplemented — composes riir-rag as-is
(`AstChunker` + `ModellessEmbedder` + `NeuronDbRetriever`) behind the
opt-in `latent_retrieval` feature. GOAT G1–G4 ALL PASS (Bench 018):
G1 100% (12/12 top-1 precision), G2 349µs/chunk (<1ms target, 2.9×
headroom), G3 104/104 lib tests, G4 `SuggestScratch` stable across 50
repeat scans. Two empirical deviations: fan-out retrieval instead of
gated routing (the 8-D centroids mis-routed fixtures — verdict is an
annotation) + multi-scale indexing/queries (corpus patterns are 1–5
line excerpts vs whole-item spans). The `cargo-heal` bin exposes it:
`cargo run --features latent_retrieval --bin cargo-heal -- --suggest src/`
(smoke: 19 files, ~0.4s incl. index build). Phase 4 (2026-08-14) landed
the top-5 rust_perf `syn` AST proposers (`src/domains/rust_perf/proposers/`,
`propose_fix` dispatch + 36 fixture tests — see
[`.docs/11_domains/rust_perf.md`](.docs/11_domains/rust_perf.md) §Proposers).
Phase 6 T6.1 wired `--fix [--write] [--quiet]` with the span-preserving
edit splice (Bench 019, G1–G4 PASS). **T6.4 (2026-08-14)** migrated the
10 clippy_lints proposers to the same emitter — shared substrate in
`src/edit_emitter.rs` (feature-neutral, re-exported by both domains),
`propose_fix` signature preserved for `self_evolve`, `--fix` extended to
the **7 structural** clippy lints (`FIXABLE_LINTS`; needless_return,
redundant_closure, redundant_field_names, manual_map, unnecessary_unwrap,
needless_range_loop, needless_lifetimes) with bounded-fixpoint application
so nested fixes compose; the 3 type-blind lints (needless_borrow,
useless_conversion, unnecessary_mut_passed) stay `self_evolve`-only.
The migration fixed four latent detection bugs in the old mutation-based
proposers (needless_lifetimes elision unsoundness incl. `FnMut(&'a S)`
positions + receivers; needless_range_loop `&v`-on-ref-param `&&Vec`
non-iterator + token-heuristic `v[v[i]]` false positive; unnecessary_unwrap
receiver mismatch) — see Plan 005 §Phase 6 T6.4 notes.

## Source secrecy & binary-only distribution (non-negotiable)

**Per [Research 003](../riir-ai/.research/003_Commercial_Open_Source_Strategy_Verdict.md):
"anything `riir-*` is internal. No exceptions."** This repo's source never
becomes public. The product surface (`cargo heal`) ships as **prebuilt
binaries only**, via GitHub Releases on a small PUBLIC distribution repo —
NOT on this repo (release assets on a private repo are not publicly
downloadable). Full design: [Proposal 003](../.proposals/003_binary_only_distribution.md).

Hard rules for any future session:

1. **Never publish source.** No `cargo publish` (already blocked:
   `publish = false` in `Cargo.toml`), no public mirrors, no source tarballs
   in release assets, no "open-source it for adoption" — that path is
   reserved for `katgpt-rs` (the public funnel) alone.
2. **Public surface = 3 tiny source-free repos**: `gist-rs/cargo-heal`
   (releases + `install.sh` + `install.ps1` + capabilities-only README),
   `gist-rs/homebrew-tap` (Formula), `gist-rs/scoop-bucket` (manifests).
   **Zero `.rs` files allowed in any of them** (CI guard). Do not create
   other public distribution surfaces without a proposal.
3. **Release binary hygiene**: build with `default + latent_retrieval +
   rust_perf` features ONLY (the `cargo-heal` bin's required-features);
   `strip = true` in the release profile; ship `SHA256SUMS` +
   `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md` in every archive (MIT/Apache binary-distribution
   obligation); never ship dev/debug builds or `ternary_inference`.
4. **Windows users** get `install.ps1` + the scoop bucket; winget only after
   Authenticode signing (deferred). macOS/Linux get `install.sh` + the brew
   tap.

## Why this is a separate repo (not in riir-ai)

The code healer borrows the **drafter+pruner+corpus pattern** from
`riir-games-quest/quest_grammar` (TernaryDraftModel + SealQuestCorpus +
ConstraintPruner), but has **zero game-domain coupling**:

- No dependency on `riir-games*`, `riir-game-sdk`, or any game crate —
  from ANY feature combination
- No dependency on `riir-chain`; `riir-neuron-db` only transitive (via
  `riir-rag` under the opt-in `latent_retrieval` feature)
- Default build: only public dep is `katgpt-core` (ConstraintPruner trait
  + ternary SIMD matvec + `pick_domain` for kernel_opt's expert router,
  Plan 558). Two opt-in feature-gated arms consume non-game sibling
  crates where reimplementation would duplicate whole substrates:
  `ternary_inference` → `riir-engine` + `riir-gpu` (Bench 010 inference
  arm); `latent_retrieval` → `riir-rag` (Plan 005 retrieval substrate,
  `cargo heal --suggest`)
- The `TernaryDraftModel` pattern is reimplemented locally (~200 LOC), not
  imported cross-workspace

Putting it in riir-ai would violate the domain boundary: riir-ai is for **game
runtime + engine**, not developer tools. The prior rejection of extracting
riir-games from riir-ai (Proposal 017 era) was correct because riir-games has
heavy bidirectional coupling with riir-engine. Code healing has no such
coupling — it's a clean, self-contained developer tool.

### Plan 001 multi-domain architecture (2026-08-13)

Plan 001 generalized the framework from a clippy-only healer into a pluggable
multi-domain framework behind the [`HealDomain`](src/domain.rs) trait. The
three domains (clippy_lints, rust_perf, kernel_opt) share the same
L0→L1→L2→L3→L4 pipeline; each domain owns its corpus + validator. **Proposal
012's GPU kernel optimizer is absorbed as the `kernel_opt` domain** (Phase 3)
— the user's correction ("why it can't be clippy?") overrode Proposal 012's
"new repo" recommendation. The trait abstraction makes future extraction a
move, not a rewrite.

**Cross-domain auto-routing** — Plan 005 Phase 1/2 (2026-08-14) shipped
the unified `cargo heal --suggest` CLI with `--domain auto`, revising the
original "not in scope" stance: `auto` **fans out across all
feature-enabled domains** with the router verdict as a per-span
annotation, NOT a gate (empirical finding — the 8-D structural centroids
mis-routed fixtures, starving the correct domain; re-gating via tuned
centroids or the 768-D embedder is a future tuning option). Each domain is
still feature-selected; requesting a feature-off domain is a hard error.
The bin stays **suggest-only** — the Phase 4 rust_perf `propose_fix`
proposers landed as library code; the `--fix` CLI wiring + the G5
real-fix gate are Phase 6 (kernel proposers Phase 5).

### `kernel_opt`-specific layers (Phase 3)

The `kernel_opt` domain adds two layers on top of the shared pipeline:

1. **`KernelExpertRouter`** (`src/domains/kernel_opt/router.rs`) — wraps
   `katgpt_core::variable_rank_domain_expert::pick_domain<15, 8>` (Plan 558).
   Activity vector = kernel signature `[M, N, K, dtype, hw, is_attention, is_fusion, is_ir_transform]`
   (8-dim — Plan 004 extended from 5 to 8 dims by adding 3 operation-class
   one-hot axes, resolving the Plan 003 C+O unreachability); domain directions
   = per-category centroids (Plan 003: hand-crafted centroids wired to the
   88-rule corpus via `KERNEL_CATEGORIES`; **15/15 categories reachable**;
   mining via `CommittedFieldBlend` deferred). The `build_activity()` helper is
   the consumer-facing constructor. Modelless argmax — zero allocation.

2. **`KernelThermalRouter`** (`src/domains/kernel_opt/thermal.rs`) — the
   FlashAR/QGF thermal-tier pattern: Plasma→Hot→Warm→Cold→Freeze escalation.
   `ThermalTier` is `#[repr(u8)]` (1 byte, sync-efficient). The scaffold
   returns Plasma for all calls (modelless-first mandate); Warm/Cold/Freeze
   require 4090 CUDA + LoRA (deferred to riir-train).

## Feature Flag Discipline

- `default` = `["clippy_lints"]`: clippy lint healing domain + L0 (corpus) + L1 (ternary drafter) + L2 (native rust-analyzer pruner)
- `clippy_lints` (default-on): the clippy lint healing domain.
- `clippy_verify` (opt-in): Phase 3 lint resolution verification via real `cargo clippy` re-run. Slow (~130ms/verify), requires cargo+clippy on PATH. Implies `clippy_lints`.
- `rust_perf` (default-on since 2026-08-13, Plan 001 Phase 2): rust performance healing domain. 46 rules from the `rust-optimize` skill checklist + nnethercote/perf-book + rustc-hash/bevy real-world patterns. Promoted after Bench 013 GOAT G1+G5 PASS; re-confirmed on the expanded corpus by Bench 015; Issue 012 (Bench 016) added 4 more rules (sort-unstable, sort-by-key, bufwriter-batched, copy-from-slice) filling sorting/IO-write/bulk-copy gaps; Issue 013 (Bench 017) added 3 data-structure-choice rules (vec-remove-front-to-vecdeque, btreemap-sorted-iteration, cow-conditional-alloc) filling the collections-choice gap. 6 of 38 benchable rules (`precompute-table`, `papaya-lockfree`, `dedupe-hashset-vs-vec`, `reuse-allocation-clear`, `sort-by-key`, `copy-from-slice`) carry `context_notes` annotations (Bench 015 + Bench 016: 2 ParetoDominated + 4 regime-fragile/Mixed in default config — consumers should treat as context-dependent).
- `rust_perf_verify` (opt-in): `cargo test` re-run for perf rule verification. Slow (seconds), requires cargo on PATH. Implies `rust_perf`.
- `rust_perf_bench` (opt-in, Plan 001 Phase 2 GOAT gate): generated microbenchmarks at multiple input sizes → Pareto verdict. **GOAT G1+G5 PASS (Bench 013 promotion + Bench 015 Phase 4 finalization + Bench 016 Issue 012 expansion + Bench 017 Issue 013 data-structure-choice expansion)** — 34/38 benchable rules Pareto-dominant (o1-lookup 570x, bsearch-sorted-slice 16-2709x, simd-chunk 3.9x, bool-to-bitpack 7-11x, branchless-conditional 10x, static-str 42x, vec-with-capacity 1.1-4.3x, format-concat-loop 42-95x, mutex-to-atomic 2.5x, f32-counter-to-int 7.5-11x, entry-vs-contains-insert 1.5x, loop-fusion 1.5x, collect-avoidance 2.3-3.0x, dyn-to-enum 2.5-2.9x, prefix-sum-2d 34-30000x, ok-or-else 97x, swap-remove 3-7927x, chunks-exact 13-16x, fxhashmap 3.3-5.8x, retain-inplace 1.3-2.0x, mem-take 1.9-2.6x, avoid-clone 1.3-3.0x, box-str-immutable 1.1-1.3x, box-avoid 9.6-42x, smallvec-stack 27-75x, buffered-io 99-132x, log-write-direct 1.9-2.0x, sort-unstable 1.08-1.25x, bufwriter-batched 2.48-21.57x, vec-remove-front-to-vecdeque 3.65-1270x, btreemap-sorted-iteration 3.73-6.91x, cow-conditional-alloc 1.32-1.49x, dedupe-hashset-vs-vec 0.92-7.5x regime-fragile, reuse-allocation-clear 0.87-4.0x regime-fragile, sort-by-key 0.99-1.02x regime-fragile, copy-from-slice 0.95-1.26x regime-fragile); 2/38 honestly dominated (precompute-table: compiler optimizes popcount to POPCNT in release; papaya-lockfree: benefit needs multi-threaded contention). Closes Proposal 001 caveat 3. Implies `rust_perf`.
- `kernel_heal` (opt-in, Plan 001 Phase 3): GPU kernel optimization healing domain. Absorbs Proposal 012. Enables `katgpt-core/variable_rank_domain_expert` for the `pick_domain` router (Plan 558). 15 category experts (Plan 003), 8-dim activity vector with 15/15 reachable (Plan 004), routed heal pipeline composed in `kernel_heal_demo` example. 4090 LoRA + real popcorn corpus DEFERRED.
- `kernel_verify` (opt-in): CubeCL compile check. **STUB** — delegates to shared `RustAnalyzerPruner`; full numeric compare deferred (Proposal 012 §Phase 0). Implies `kernel_heal`.
- `ruliology_search` (opt-in): L3 Pareto-front candidate search. Reuses the algorithm pattern from `katgpt-ruliology` (Bench 572) without a code-level dep. Runs once per lint invocation (~400µs/10 candidates), not per-tick. Implies `clippy_lints`.
- `latent_retrieval` (opt-in, Plan 005 Phase 1): real-file span-level latent retrieval — the `--suggest` MVP. Indexes every enabled domain's corpus via riir-rag (`RuleIndex`: `ShardIndex` Clifford-wedge KNN + BM25, multi-scale), routes spans via corpus-derived domain centroids (`DomainRouter`, annotation only), retrieves ranked rules (`LatentMatcher`, fan-out across enabled domains). The suggest path itself has ZERO proposer code — suggestions are the corpus pattern texts; the proposers live in each domain's `proposers/` module (rust_perf Phase 4, clippy T6.4) + the shared `src/edit_emitter.rs` substrate, gated by the proposers' own Cargo features. Gates `dep:riir-rag` (heavy tree: riir-rag + transitively riir-neuron-db — the default build stays light). Powers the `cargo-heal` bin (`--suggest` / `--fix` / `--domain auto|clippy|perf|kernel` / `--top-k`). **GOAT G1–G4 ALL PASS (Bench 018, 2026-08-14):** G1 100% (12/12 top-1, target ≥80%), G2 349µs/chunk (<1ms, 2.9× headroom), G3 104 lib tests, G4 `SuggestScratch` stable across 50 repeat scans. Known limits: fan-out routing (no gate), no minimum-score threshold (every span suggests), 12-item G1 fixture.
- `self_evolve` (opt-in, Issue 004 + Issue 008): latent-first self-evolution loop — `LatentFixMemory` (3-axis retrieval over fix trajectories) + `LatentSkillEvolution` (EMA direction-vector update). GOAT G1-G5 ALL PASS (G5: 70pp healing rate improvement in controlled fixture). **G6/G7 validated against real cargo clippy feedback (Issue 008): G6 10/10 corpus truthfulness PASS, G7 50.0pp improvement (50% → 100%) PASS.** Borrows `dot+sigmoid` from riir-agents + 3-axis retrieval from riir-rag, reimplemented locally (~730 LOC, boundary-compliant). Stays opt-in (deployment-environment constraint: `clippy_verify` is itself opt-in). The mechanism is validated; the opt-in gate is not a correctness concern.
- `wasm_pruner` (opt-in, deferred): L2 WASM rust-analyzer variant (blocked on rubrc)
- `clippy_lora` (opt-in, deferred): L4 adaptive LoRA fallback (blocked on riir-train integration)
- `ternary_inference` (opt-in, Bench 010): katgpt ternary generation on clippy prompts. The pre-existing compile error (`attn_sub_on` not found in riir-gpu) was **FIXED** in riir-ai commit `4bfe3b30` — the cfg gate on `attn_sub_on` + `ATTN_SUBSTAGE_MASK` + `ATTN_SUBSTAGE_ALL` was relaxed from `all(cubecl_runtime, ternary_gemm_batched)` to just `cubecl_runtime` (behavior-preserving: the mask defaults to all-on). `--all-features` CI layer 4 now passes clean.

The modelless path (L0-L3) is PRIMARY. LoRA (L4) is the conservative last resort.
The self-evolution layer (Issue 004) is additive — it composes on top of L0-L2
without modifying the frozen pipeline. `rust_perf` was promoted to default-on
2026-08-13 (Bench 013 GOAT G1+G5 PASS) with the 2 ParetoDominated rules
carrying `context_notes` annotations ("demote loser" per global rule). The
annotations now propagate end-to-end through the drafter via a non-breaking
default method `HealEntry::context_notes() -> Option<&str> { None }` →
`DraftedFix::context_notes` (2026-08-13 post-promotion wiring). The drafter
surfaces the annotation; the consumer decides whether their context matches.
`kernel_opt` is NOT promoted to default-on until its GOAT gate (real corpus +
full numeric validator) passes.

## Documentation Shape

This repo ships a **11-folder numbered `.docs/` book** (opened 2026-08-11,
Issue 007; the 11th folder was added for the Plan 001 domains), matching the `riir-ai/.docs/` / `riir-neuron-db/.docs/` /
`riir-game-sdk/.docs/` format: numbered folders for sort order, unnumbered
`.md` files inside, each folder has a `README.md` index with a purpose
blockquote + file table + "See also" cross-refs.

| Folder | Scope |
|---|---|
| `01_orientation/` | Crate role, sibling layout, boundary rationale, multi-domain architecture (Plan 001), build commands, numbering |
| `02_corpus/` | L0 rule distillation: `Corpus<D>` (generic) + BLAKE3 commitment + per-domain seed corpora |
| `03_drafter/` | L1 ternary SIMD matvec: `TernaryDrafter` (generic over `E: HealEntry`) + BLAKE3 `embedder` + Plan 005 latent retrieval (`RuleIndex`/`DomainRouter`/`LatentMatcher`, `--suggest` MVP, Bench 018 GOAT G1–G4) |
| `04_pruner/` | L2 syn validator: `RustAnalyzerPruner` + `ValidationResult` + honesty contract |
| `05_clippy_verify/` | clippy lint resolution: `ClippyVerifier` (opt-in `clippy_verify`) |
| `06_ruliology/` | L3 Pareto-front: `RuliologySearch` + `pareto_front` + `ast_delta_size` (opt-in) |
| `07_examples/` | The 8 in-tree examples (`heal_demo`, `perf_heal_demo`, `perf_bench_demo`, `kernel_heal_demo`, `clippy_verify_demo`, `ruliology_search_demo`, `self_evolve_real_world_demo`, `stage2_tuning_demo`) + the `cargo-heal` bin (Plan 005 `--suggest` CLI) |
| `08_benchmarks/` | GOAT gate methodology + measured results |
| `09_lessons/` | Canonical patterns: borrow-without-dep, modelless-first, freeze/thaw, honest POC caveats, sigmoid-not-softmax |
| `10_self_evolve/` | Issue 004 + Issue 008: latent-first self-evolution loop (`HealPipeline` + `LatentFixMemory` + `LatentSkillEvolution`, opt-in `self_evolve`; G1–G7 ALL PASS) |
| `11_domains/` | **Plan 001 Phase 2+3**: multi-domain architecture — `rust_perf` (Phase 2) + `kernel_opt` (Phase 3, absorbs Proposal 012) |

The top-level `.docs/README.md` is the index. `README.md` (repo root) remains
the build surface (Status + Quick Start + Usage); `AGENTS.md` (this file)
remains the authoritative repo-local context.

For `.docs/`: files inside numbered folders have **no number prefix**.
Filenames are bare slugs (e.g. `crate_role.md`). The folder number provides
sort order; the filename provides identity. Add a new doc by dropping
`slug.md` in the right group folder and adding one line to that folder's
`README.md` index table.

## Numbering Discipline

Issue, plan, doc, benchmark, and research numbers are **monotonic and never
reused**. Before creating a new `.issues/` file, read `.issues/.highwater`, use
`value + 1`, write back. Same for `.plans/`, `.docs/`, `.benchmarks/`, `.research/`.

## Branch

`develop` is the working branch. Commit directly on `develop` per the global rule.
